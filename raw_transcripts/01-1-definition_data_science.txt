PROFESSOR: Think about data analysis.
Often, what may comes to mind is the sense
of looking at charts, or graphs, or numbers,
and really trying to dig into analyze those numbers
and figure out what they mean, or at least be
able to reproduce them with a model.
But I would suggest that you might
want to think about it more like a translation process, where
you're taking a lot of data, which may be numbers
or whatever, but you're really trying to extract information
from it and communicate it to other humans
so that you're not operating on data in a vacuum.
Just like from our Mars data, we're not just
looking at it as numbers, but you're really trying to say,
what can we pull out from this data
that would advance science, or medicine, or astronomy,
or whatever the domain is?
What's the knowledge that's in there?
And that means that whatever you pull out of your data
needs to be communicable to humans.
And so I think that should be a guiding directive when you're
working with large data sets.
